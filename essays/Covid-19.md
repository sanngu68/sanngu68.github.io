# Daily Routine
With a natural disaster on such a global scale, there are bound to be massive changes to everyone's lifestyle. For me personally, I've seen
pretty small changes to my daily routine. The major change is having to learn remotely from home but most of my classes were already tuned to
be learned from home. In fact, I feel that the requirements of students, especially for me, are even harsher than before. Since we no
longer have a face-to-face interaction, learning and understanding concepts feel more difficult but it is more convenient to get the
assistance that you need. In addition, I still have a part-time job on campus so I still have to wake up early and go to school. Overall, my
daily routine hasn't changed much from before until now.

# Consequences
While the changes are on the smaller side, the effects are rather large. Due to the new state policy, my family's income has been dramatically
reduced due to my mother's business not being considered essential. As such, I am currently the only member of my family that is making
any income at all. Along with this, my workplace has been very busy with calls coming from faculty, staff, and students asking for assistance
about various technical issues due to everyone working and learning from home. Hopefully, people will eventually adjust to the situation
but for now, we have to help them along with getting situated.

# Ignorance
Despite the announcements and recommendations, I still notice that many people are not taking the situation quite as seriously as they should
be or even denying that such a disaster is occuring in the first place. Every day, I see news about people either avoiding safety procedures or are highlighted doing various activities that risk everyone
around them. Regarding this, I feel that in a such a particular time, everyone in the community should do their part to restrain themselves
from various luxuries to benefit the community as a whole. However, it seems that all it takes to ruin these positives is just a single person.
As such, I feel that it is beneficial to have more than just recommended procedures announced and have them actually enforced to secure
the safety of the overall community.
