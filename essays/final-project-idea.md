# Overview
By now, students should be familiar with the Laulima site and its many tools. However, if it isn't already clear, Laulima is not friendly
towards new users. Navigation around the site and trying to find the correct resources can be a nightmare due to the much outdated UI.
Even professors have difficulty making use of Laulima's tools to create, publish, and grade their assignments. This results from a resource
that is not very intuitive to use and improvements are extremely limited on the site itself. Even the Help 
section that explains the site lacks in proper clarity. However, if this resource is something that is officially mandated by the school, 
what could serve as an alternative?

The solution? A external application called Lokahi that allows students and instructors to be able to add courses to their profile and
utilize tools similar to Laulima but in an updated and cleaner environment. These courses may contain features such as a forums and links
to external resources that are easier to find. In addition, course information can be shown directly on the site along with information 
about the instructor that is teaching the course.

# Approach
The user can create their profile and then add the courses that they have for the semester. They are then able to access these course sites
and navigate to find further information about the course or collaborate with others who may be taking the class with them. Instructors
will have the ability to join the class with an instructor role, where they will have access to edit changes on the page and create
announcements or attach resources as necessary. Administrators will have similar access but they are able to monitor the courses and the
participants of each course to make necessary changes as needed.

Some mock up pages:
<div class="ui bulleted list">
  <div class="item">Landing Page</div>
  <div class="item">Student Home Page</div>
  <div class="item">Student Course Page</div>
  <div class="item">Instructor Home Page</div>
  <div class="item">Instructor Course Page</div>
  <div class="item">Admin Home Page</div>
  <div class="item">Admin Course List Page</div>
  <div class="item">Admin Course Page</div>
</div>

# Case Ideas
<div class="ui bulleted list">
  <div class="item">Student goes to landing page, logs in, goes to home page, goes to course page, navigates/interacts with site</div>
  <div class="item">Instructor goes to landing page, logs in, goes to home page, goes to course page, edits site</div>
  <div class="item">Admin goes to landing page, logs in, goes to home page, goes to list of courses, goes to course page, edits site</div>
</div>

# Beyond the Basics
After the basic functions of the site are completed, we can start to polish up the site's implemented assets and add additional 
features including a gradebook, Grade Point Average calculator for current semester, FAQ/Help section, and administrated course reviews.
