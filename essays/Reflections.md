# A Look Back
It's the end of the term and I think that it's an appropriate time to look back at what I learned over the course of this class. I feel that
I've not only learned how to "program", but I've learned the important fundamentals behind how to be a "good" software programmer. To clarify,
I was able to review and strengthen my previous knowledge with programming while learning more about how to manage my time, projects, tools,
and style that related to software. In this way, I found that there exists basic universal standards on how programming works and the main ways
of making your software both appealing and effective in what you are trying to solve. The main takeaways that I want to discuss here are
UI frameworks, agile project management, and design patterns.

# Appearance Matters
One of the topics that we were introduced to was about UI frameworks and how they can extensively improve overall appearance, user-friendliness,
and efficiency of both your application and development. This semester, we used Semantic UI as our framework, which I was able to see how
such a thing is able to be very useful. It drastically made our application development much easier when using certain elements

# Application of Management
As we can see, something like a design feature is almost imperative for not only solving problems but also teaching valuable skills to those that
are taking on such challenges. Rather than leaving an inexperienced programmer to face a seemingly impossible task, by giving them a template
on what it takes to finish the problem, the programmer can start to pick up things after they try and go through their own trial-and-error testing.
This can be a sure way to quickly gain experience and most likely, the programmer can use the skills that they learn here to implement in other
projects in the future. Even then, most design patterns that exist today can always be adapted to many situations and even be improved on to be
more efficient or better adapted to more situations.
