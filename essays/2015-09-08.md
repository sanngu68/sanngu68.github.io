After going through the basic Javascript course, I can say that it is much simpler than that of the previous languages that I have learned. While very similar to Java, it feels more toned down and easier to do certain commands such as printing lines but I feel that it still requires a bit of memorization to really grasp the entire langauge. I have learned a bit of Javascript before in my high school STEM class but I only learned the simple things for creating a website alongside HTML and CSS. In terms of how it can be used in software engineering, I can definitely see the appeal of how quick and concise it is compared to something like Java.

As for the Software Engineering course, I find that it is a lot of grasp for the first couple of weeks in terms of what is expected of us. From the first day, I feel that the pace is very fast and there is almost always something that you are working on. This also takes into account other courses that we could be taking as I find that there will be far less free time in this semester. In terms of the practice WOD's, I find that they are extremely helpful and I find myself using them as a form of practice just to get the experience in. There is no better teacher than practice and I feel like if I keep doing it, I'll eventually be comfortable at anything that will be assigned.

The class so far is also quite interesting. I'm not new to a "flipped classroom" type of course but I find that it is more engaging since you can use the time that you have to learn and study while utilizing the time in class with your professor to get in your practice and questions. While it does rely more on the student's responsibility, I feel that the pros outweigh the cons. However, I feel that one of the biggest issues with this is that if a student has a lot of classes, they will find it very difficult to balance their time and attention to each class. This is especially true if they have to work at a part-time job since that will be less hours of studying and practice.

Overall, I find that the class is currently enjoyable and I feel like everything that we do has some purpose. The practice and learning that we get in will help us for the present and also the future.
