For our final project for ICS 111, my group and I decided to create a classic 2D shooter that involved the player moving a ship and shooting aliens for points. There was also a restart button in case someone actually wanted to continue playing. It was an easy project to code as it utilized skills that we learned from previous projects in the class and also some things that I looked up outside of class. 

While it was a relatively easy project, this was the first project where we were working as a group so I was unsure how to split up the work evenly. Unfortunately, the people I worked with had less understanding of programming Java so I took the responsibility to do more for the assignment. In the end, one person in our group did not contribute to their part so I had to make up for their unfinished portion and had to go through checking for any errors and bugs before finally turning it in. Overall, I learned a lot about group work and collaboration from this project.
